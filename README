A slightly more sophisticated replacement for less.sh that also supports being
set as the PAGER environment variable.
Displays man pages, perldocs and python documentation properly. 

Definitely works on Linux, Solaris, OSX and Cygwin.

Should work in most other places, if it detects your "ps" correctly.


INSTALL DETAILS

Put these in your shell config, for example ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc 
 export PAGER=vimpager
